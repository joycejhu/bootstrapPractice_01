                            <p class="mt-2">Singer of South Korea. He is a member of the boy group SUPER JUNIOR and takes on the roles of lead dancer, lead vocalist, and sub-rapper. He is an all-rounder who can handle all positions above average. His real name is Lee Donghae. This name was acquired because he used the honorary title 東子 (Dong-ja) of the Lee clan from Jeonju, not related to Donghae City in Gangwon Province. He was born in Mokpo, Jeollanam-do. Since his name is Donghae, he disliked class time because his friends would mock him by singing the national anthem every time attendance was called.</p>

                    <h3 class="fst-italic">Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Considered an all-rounder in SUPER JUNIOR along with Eunhyuk, he possesses exceptional musical abilities at the highest level within the team, whether it's vocals, rap, dance, songwriting, or producing. He is also active with Eunhyuk as SUPER JUNIOR-D&E, and has participated in writing and composing most of their title tracks. Within the team, he is responsible for lead vocals, lead dancer, and sub-rapper, and his rap skills are also of a high standard, making him a member who can fill any gaps that may arise. He is also considered a visual member, like Siwon and Heechul in Super Junior. That's quite an impressive combination. Recently, he showcased his outstanding rap skills through the digital single "Blue Moon," and his accumulated experience is already remarkable, but there is even greater anticipation for his future.</p>
